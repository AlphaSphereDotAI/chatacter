# Glass with Computer Vision
AI-powered smart glasses use artificial intelligence to describe objects and read text aloud, helping the visually impaired. Some also have facial recognition, which can be used to identify people the wearer knows or to scan for information about them. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the lives of people with visual impairments, giving them a greater degree of independence and allowing them to participate more fully in society. AI-powered smart glasses are a type of wearable technology that uses artificial intelligence to help people with visual impairments. The glasses have a built-in camera that can scan the environment and identify objects, which are then spoken aloud to the wearer. This allows people with visual impairments to navigate their surroundings more easily and independently. Some smart glasses also have facial recognition capabilities, which can be used to identify people the wearer knows or to scan for information about them. This can be helpful for people with visual impairments who want to stay connected with friends and family or who need to access information quickly and easily. AI-powered smart glasses are still in their initial stages of development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the lives of people with visual impairments. By providing them with greater independence and access to information, these glasses can help people with visual impairments live more fulfilling and productive lives.
