However, developing chatbots with contextual awareness and varied responses remains challenging.</p> <p>Our project aims to develop conversation agents that possess unique qualities. These agents will be visually represented by avatars of historical figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Albert Einstein. This approach will enhance the interaction and reflect the historical context. We plan to expand beyond text-based interactions and explore incorporating additional ways, such as audio or cameras. This effort aims to create a more comprehensive and natural communication experience.</p> <p>To achieve this, we will use pre-trained language models such as Microsoft Phi-2 as a foundation and fine-tune them individually for each character. This process will involve tailoring the language models to the specific historical context, personality, and knowledge base of each figure. Our approach is based on using the strengths of LLMs to generate human-like text. We plan to fine-tune individual models for each character to ensure that each response aligns with their unique traits and speech patterns. This helps to create more engaging and immersive conversations.</p> <p>The applications of AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents simulating historical figures are wide-ranging and offer significant value across various domains.

These issues are attributed to the reliance on learning from coupled 2D motion fields, which can lead to unnatural and incoherent results. Moreover, the use of explicit 3D information has been found to introduce its own set of problems, such as stiff expressions and videos that lack coherence. One of the most powerful models is SadTalker. To address these challenges, SadTalker has been developed. This system generates 3D motion coefficients, including head pose and facial expressions, from audio using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) and modulates a novel 3D-aware face render to create talking head videos. SadTalker stands out by explicitly modeling the connections between audio and several types of motion coefficients individually, which helps in achieving more accurate facial expressions and head movements. To learn the realistic motion coefficients, we explicitly model the connections between audio and several types of motion coefficients individually. Precisely, we present ExpNet to learn the accurate facial expression from audio by distilling both coefficients and 3D-rendered faces.</p>"},{"location":"docs/#components","title":"Components","text":"<ul> <li>ExpNet: This component is designed to learn accurate facial expressions directly from audio.
