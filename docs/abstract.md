# Abstract

Recently, chatbots have gained attention for their natural language interactions. However, developing chatbots with contextual awareness and varied responses remains challenging.

Our project aims to develop conversation agents that possess unique qualities. These agents will be visually represented by avatars of historical figures such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Albert Einstein. This approach will enhance the interaction and reflect the historical context. We plan to expand beyond text-based interactions and explore incorporating additional ways, such as audio or cameras. This effort aims to create a more comprehensive and natural communication experience.

To achieve this, we will use pre-trained language models such as Microsoft Phi-2 as a foundation and fine-tune them individually for each character. This process will involve tailoring the language models to the specific historical context, personality, and knowledge base of each figure. Our approach is based on using the strengths of LLMs to generate human-like text. We plan to fine-tune individual models for each character to ensure that each response aligns with their unique traits and speech patterns. This helps to create more engaging and immersive conversations.

The applications of AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents simulating historical figures are wide-ranging and offer significant value across various domains. In education, they can serve as personalized virtual tutors, bringing historical figures to life and facilitating interactive learning experiences that enhance comprehension and critical thinking. In the entertainment industry, these agents create immersive and captivating experiences by enabling audiences to engage in interactive storytelling, games, and virtual reality experiences with iconic figures from history. Museums and historical sites can use them to provide visitors with a more interactive and enriching experience by incorporating virtual interactions with historical figures into exhibits.

Beyond these specific domains, the applications of these agents extend to any field where interaction with historical figures could be beneficial, such as healthcare and business.

Overall, these agents have the potential to deepen our understanding of the past, inform our present, and inspire our future.
